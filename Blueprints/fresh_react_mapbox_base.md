# React Mapbox Base Framework Implementation Plan

## Introduction

### Project Overview
This framework serves as a foundational canvas for building sophisticated mapping applications using React and Mapbox GL JS. Rather than creating individual mapping applications from scratch, this base framework provides a robust, reusable foundation that can be extended for various specialized use cases while maintaining consistency in core functionality and user experience.

### Key Motivations
- **Eliminate Technical Debt**: By establishing a clean, well-architected base, we prevent the accumulation of technical debt that often occurs when building multiple similar applications independently.
- **Standardize Implementation**: Create consistent patterns for common mapping features, reducing maintenance overhead and improving code quality across applications.
- **Optimize Performance**: Build performance considerations into the core architecture rather than treating it as an afterthought.
- **Enhance Developer Experience**: Provide type-safe interfaces and clear patterns that make it easier to build and maintain mapping applications.

### Architectural Decisions

#### 1. React-Map-GL Integration
We've chosen react-map-gl as our core mapping library because:
- It provides a fully reactive wrapper for Mapbox GL JS
- Enables better state management through React patterns
- Offers superior TypeScript support
- Facilitates complex features like viewport synchronization
- Maintains close alignment with native Mapbox GL JS capabilities

#### 2. Modular Architecture
The framework is built around four core systems:
- **Map Container System**: Handles map initialization, controls, and events
- **Panel System**: Provides flexible, dockable UI components that can sync with map state
- **State Management**: Implements a clean, type-safe state management solution
- **Marker System**: Offers a robust, UUID-based system for marker management

#### 3. Performance First
Performance considerations are built into every layer:
- Viewport-based rendering optimizations
- Efficient state updates
- Component memoization
- Data virtualization for large datasets

#### 4. Developer Experience
The framework prioritizes developer experience through:
- Comprehensive TypeScript support
- Clear, consistent patterns
- Extensive documentation
- Example implementations
- Testing utilities

### Implementation Strategy
The implementation is divided into phases to ensure:
- Core functionality is established early
- Features are built incrementally
- Testing is integrated throughout
- Documentation keeps pace with development
- Examples demonstrate best practices
